# Lesson 1 Learning Notes

## Key MLOps Concepts Learned
1. **Model Lifecycle:** Unlike code, ML models degrade over time
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from raw data
3. **Model Serving:** Exposing ML models as REST APIs
4. **Reproducibility:** Using seeds and version control

## DevOps vs MLOps Differences
- **Data Dependencies:** Models depend on training data quality
- **Performance Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall vs uptime, latency  
- **Model Drift:** Performance degrades over time without retraining
- **Experimentation:** A/B testing models vs feature flags

## Next Steps
- Deploy to AWS ECS
- Add model monitoring
- Implement CI/CD for ML models
