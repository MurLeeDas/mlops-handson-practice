docker build -t churn-system:v4.0 .
docker run -p 8000:8000 churn-system:v4.0
```

### **Test All Capabilities:**
```bash
# Basic prediction
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"age": 35, "monthly_charges": 65.5, "total_charges": 1200.0}'

# Reliable prediction with circuit breaker  
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict/reliable \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"age": 35, "monthly_charges": 65.5, "total_charges": 1200.0}'

# Explainable prediction (GDPR compliance)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict/reliable?require_explanation=true" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"age": 35, "monthly_charges": 65.5, "total_charges": 1200.0}'

# Compare all model versions
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/compare \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"age": 35, "monthly_charges": 65.5, "total_charges": 1200.0}'

# System health and monitoring

## 🏆 **Enterprise Patterns Demonstrated**

### **Reliability Engineering**
```python
@circuit_breaker(failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=30)
def predict_with_reliability(customer_data):
    # Same pattern Netflix uses for recommendations
    return model_router.route_prediction(customer_data)
```

### **Compliance Automation**  
```python
@compliance_required
def generate_explainable_prediction(customer_data):
    # GDPR-ready ML predictions
    prediction = model.predict(customer_data)
    explanation = explainer.generate_explanation(prediction)
    return ComplianceReport(prediction, explanation, audit_trail)
```

### **Performance Monitoring**
```python
@monitor_performance
def route_prediction(customer_data):
    # Real-time metrics collection  
    metrics.record_request()
    result = model.predict(customer_data)
    metrics.record_latency()
    return result
```
